# Multiple Linear Regression

> **Note:** This repo is related to my second homework assignment for ISE537 at NC State University.

## Overview

This project is based on two default data sets in R: `Framingham` and `Fish`. The first section focuses on the `Framingham` data and answers some conceptual questions about multiple linear regression. 

The remainder of the Quarto document is an end-to-end data science problem that attempts to predict the weight from the `Fish` data set, including:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Model fitting
- Model diagnostics
- Performance assessment
